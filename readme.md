# Bubble Shooter js

This is an attempt to implement the game bubble shooter in JS. This is one of
my first projects in js so it probably won't be stellar in style.

This uses the canvas element to draw shapes on the screen and create the game.

Doc.html can be used to view the game.

The bubble.js file uses a canvas with the id "myCanvas"
